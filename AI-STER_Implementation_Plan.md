# AI-STER Project Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

The AI-STER (Artificial Intelligence - Student Teaching Evaluation Rubric) project contains comprehensive evaluation rubrics and competency data for assessing student teachers, but currently lacks a digital implementation. This plan outlines the development of a modern web-based platform to digitize the evaluation process, improve efficiency, and provide data analytics capabilities.

## Current State Analysis

### Assets Available
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Complete evaluation rubrics in markdown format
- **Structured Data**: JSON competency data with scoring levels and descriptions
- **Two Assessment Tools**:
  - 3-week Field Formative Evaluation Rubric (early field experiences)
  - Student Teaching Evaluation Rubric (STER) - summative assessment
- **Professional Dispositions Framework**: 6 core dispositions with detailed criteria
- **USBE Compliance**: Aligned with Utah State Board of Education standards (approved July 2024)

### Current Limitations
- No digital platform or application code
- Manual evaluation processes
- Limited data analysis capabilities
- No automated scoring or progress tracking
- No centralized data management system

## Recommended Technology Stack

## Database Schema Design

### Core Tables
```sql
-- Users and Roles
users (id, email, name, role, institution_id, created_at, updated_at)
institutions (id, name, type, usbe_code)

-- Evaluation Structure
rubric_types (id, name, type, version) -- 'field_evaluation', 'ster'
competency_areas (id, name, description, order_index)
assessment_items (id, rubric_type_id, competency_area_id, code, title, context, description)
scoring_levels (id, assessment_item_id, level, description, example_justification)

-- Evaluation Instances
evaluations (id, student_id, evaluator_id, rubric_type_id, status, created_at, completed_at)
evaluation_responses (id, evaluation_id, assessment_item_id, score, justification, notes)
disposition_scores (id, evaluation_id, disposition_type, score, scored_by)

-- Progress Tracking
student_progress (id, student_id, competency_area_id, average_score, evaluation_count, last_updated)
```

## API Design

### Authentication Endpoints
- `POST /api/auth/login`
- `POST /api/auth/logout`
- `POST /api/auth/refresh`
