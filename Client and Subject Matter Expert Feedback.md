Action Items:
AI Justification and Scoring: Implement a feature where the AI generates justifications and the supervisor assigns scores based on those justifications. 
Formative and Summative Evaluations: Add an option for the system to recognize and differentiate between formative and summative evaluations, including graying out completed formative evaluations. 
Evaluation Type Selection: Ensure the system can track the number of formative assessments for each student teacher and recognize when a summative evaluation is required. 
Dispositions Feedback: Include a comment box under each disposition for supervisors to manually input feedback and suggestions. 
Summative Evaluation Generation: Add an option to generate summative evaluations based on the cumulative scores from formative evaluations. 
Evaluation Report Distribution: Implement a feature to send the completed evaluation report to the student, supervisor, and cooperative teacher via email. 
Rubric Access: Add a link to the actual stir rubric within the interface for supervisors to refer to during evaluations. 
Lesson Plan Requirement: Ensure the system allows supervisors to proceed with evaluations even if a lesson plan is not uploaded, while still encouraging its submission. 

Data Storage - Implement a system to store all evaluations and lesson plans for each student teacher, including both formative and summative evaluations. 

Duration of Data Storage - Ensure the system can store data for the entire accreditation cycle, approximately seven years. 

Replacing Qualtrics - Develop the system to potentially replace Qualtrics by storing all evaluations and lesson plans. Include functionality to download and upload data to Qualtrics if needed. 

Knowledge Base - Utilize a knowledge base to store synthesized data in vector format, compatible with the large language model being used. This knowledge base will be efficient and require minimal storage space. 

Data Synthesis - Implement data synthesis to remove personal information and store it indefinitely as a knowledge base. Maintain a separate regular database to keep original data for retrieval when needed. 

Regular Database - Add a regular database to keep data in its original form, ensuring that all original evaluations, lesson plans, and other relevant documents are stored securely and can be retrieved when necessary.
