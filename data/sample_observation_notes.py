SAMPLE_OBSERVATION_NOTES = """#1
Strengths:
Great hook at the beginning of the lesson! You had 100% engagement during that time. Great way to catch their attention at the beginning of the lesson.
Use of technology that you seem very comfortable using. Use of the microphone so they can all hear. The technology allows you to be able to walk around as you teach.
Work with your shoulder partner to find the solution on how many ears of corn was sold. I love any and all opportunities for students to be able to turn and talk to each other.
Use of proximity as they are working together. Helps with classroom management as well as taking those informal assessments.
Specific feedback to what you observed when they were working in their groups. -very thoughtful in the partners you had share with the whole class.
Encouraged math talk in how they solved the problem not just asking for those right answer but explanation. Different math strategies shown.
Called on a variety of students and knew their names! Had student read the story problem.
You asked great questions during the discussion on how the two equations were the same and different using math vocabulary words. When students are sharing you ask thoughtful follow up questions to respond. You clarified with students' misconceptions, leading them to understand the difference between factors and product.
Signpost-thumbs up if you have it all written. Great way to know when to move on for transitions. When you are done writing the definition put your hands on your head.
Differentiation: Vocabulary page: They could either copy down exactly what you wrote or come up with their own way.
Great example of the WE DO portion of the lesson, very structured and supported in getting them to independent work.
Fast finishers-had a plan if they get done with the problems. Great idea to always have a plan because they will finish.
Suggestions/Questions:
Repeated reads can help with story problems. First read, what is it about? Second read, what is the important information in the story. Third read, what is it asking us to do? A test taking skill to for math problems to filter out the fluff and see what it is really asking.
Use of specific, positive praise, "Thank you Josh for having your eyes on me!" That way they will know your expectations through that positive praise.
Any positive reinforcements that you can implement to reinforce those modeled behaviors.
Make sure to set the expectations of what to do during direct instruction. Pencils down, not playing with things in desks.

#1 Spring Observations:
Use of positive praise and reinforcements with table points. You were specific with your praise.
You are very engaging in your teaching, very validating to their answers.
Signpost-give ne a thumbs up if your paper matches mine and you are done.
Expectations: put your pencils down.
Great use of technology for students to be able to follow along. Be thinking of how to use technology that is student centered.
Great use of proximity while students are thinking of a sentence. It helps with classroom management as well as taking those quick informal assessments. I saw several times you were able to redirect students who were not on task.
Pair share: cooperating learner; all students are able to share their own sentences.
Read underline words together; great strategy to use for fluency.
Call and response, "Class Class." They did well with meeting those expectations. When they did not you had them practice again.
Directions stated and had another student repeat them to you when they started reading out loud.
Thanked them specifically for meeting your expectations. Praised student who had a quiet hand raised.
I DO: "noise" modeled for them.
Crowd, bounce, loudly they did on their own but went over together. Plenty of guided support to help them get to independent practice. It was a gradual release of instruction.
Using microphone so all students can hear you and have access to the instruction.
I love that you were able to show them that you make mistakes too and it is ok!
Pencils down, book closed, put away packets. Stating expectations.
Suggestions/Questions:
Giving feedback to those assessments you see not just "good job" or "try again." Tell them specifically what they did a good job at or where they need to work on.
When you did "uncoiled" broken down you did a great job of guided their thoughts. Use that as a tool to guide your instruction that they might be confused on prefix, suffix, and diphthong.
Be thinking of ways for students to create, track and reflect on goals. (We discussed this.)
Did not wait for everyone to have their tapping fingers out.
Wait time: when asking questions try not to call on the first person who raises their hands. For some students they need that wait time to process what you are asking and form an answer. You will see that class participation increase as well.
Is this pretty scripted?

#2
Strengths:
Great job frontloading them with directions before you had them go inside.
Positive praise when students got to work quickly on their self-start. Use of table points as a positive reinforcement!
Very specific feedback to their work. "I like how you added the line here." Guided the students who were struggling on certain problems, giving them specific and clear instructions.
Realized the students were all struggling on #10 and decided to go over that whole class.
Call and response "Class Class." Had them try again when they did not meet the expectations.
Quick multiplication facts timed for one minute. Love the warm up activity to practice quick mental math.
When they starting to get chatty with the transition you did a great job praising as well as positively reinforcing.
Great job reading the story problem, then asking what the important information is, asked them if they knew which seasons they were looking at.
Vocab review/pre-assessment: what is a "key"? They are also using context clues.
Great use of proximity as they were working on the beginning problem, giving that specific feedback to assessment. Your proximity also helps with classroom management and motivating students to try the problem.
Had a few students share their examples-very thoughtful on who you chose to show different strategies. Very validating to their answers, helps create a very safe and positive learning environment.
Great job including your student in such a positive that way that struggles with his behavior.
Turn and talk to share what they wrote. Giving them opportunities to talk to their peers. Differentiates for students who might not have written anything.
Had a plan for fast finishers when they finished their exit ticket. Had them check off their exit ticket with you so you can assess how they did. I love that it is automatic feedback that can be corrected before they move on.
Student choice if they want to be working with a partner or not. As well as the math menu. Give them the opportunity for student choice in what they must do and can do.
Differentiation: give students a challenge because they are mastering the content. Not just giving them more work, but enriching what it is they are doing.
Stop the class to give them a time limit-helps with time management and giving them directions for what is next.
Set expectations throughout the lesson and held them-please raise your hands.
Whole class incentives like class points, creates that positive feedback.
Suggestions:
For LL6 be thinking of how you can make the lesson applicable to them with real-world scenarios, connecting it to their future selves, engaging with the community, etc.
IP 8 think of how you can integrate technology to engage students that is student-centered. (Creating a project, Nearpod, Kahoot, just as examples.)
IP6 the lesson is grounded in student's interests or background needs. Could be changing story problems to what the students are interested in, changing it to their names within the problems, etc.
When giving directions make sure you are not competing with their voices. You can just say "I will wait," so you don't feel like you are talking over them.
IC7 A variety of instructional strategies: Cooperative learning groups, project-based learning, technology.

#3:
Strengths:
Cooperative learning-what is force and motion.
You did a great job managing what was going on with the hurt student and students not focusing. Having them do something while you figure out technology. Pull out a book and read. You were nurse, teacher, mom, cheerleader, all in one lesson!
Positive reinforcement-class points for how well they waited for the video to pull up.
Gave expectations for how to watch the video (Front loaded them.)
Anticipatory set-hooked the class right at the beginning with the tug of war video.
Great wait time when asking questions-you encourage them to participate.
Great questioning that are not just memorizing facts but trying to deepen their understanding.
Great job with technology integration that is student-centered! What an engaging way to teach using different instructional strategies!
Reset the noise level when they started to get really loud. Customize their characters while they are waiting for others to join the Kahoot.
Use of proximity as students are getting onto computers.
Call and response "Class Class" and practiced again when they did not meet your expectations.
I will wait until you are all ready to move on. And you waited.
I love that you included their names into the Kahoot! With their likes! Makes it applicable and relevant to them to create that engagement and connection to the material!
You did a great job managing their excitement for the material and lesson.
Suggestions/Questions:
Is this their first time learning about balance and unbalanced forces? Was the Kahoot question at the beginning a pre-assessment?
Remember to positive praise those students who are meeting your expectations.
LL7: Giving them the timely feedback if they got the answers wrong in the Kahoot.

#4:
Strengths:
Reminded them of their prior lesson (background knowledge.). Great discussion that had a built-in pre-assessment to see what the remember about balanced and unbalanced forces.
Great job giving them a question or purpose for watching the video.
Cooperative learning-turn and talk to your neighbor. Try to answer this question. Love the opportunities you give them to talk with their peers.
Call and response "Waterfall" they meet your expectations really well.
Everyone says, "friction!" Restated expectations for students to be sitting as well.
Made this applicable to them with sports they like to play! Very relevant and they are able to connect with the lesson.
Positive reinforcements to reward the students meeting your expectations. They all quickly settled down to listen quickly.
Very engaging getting students out of their desks and moving! Having them come demonstrate throwing the football and showing force. Have them explain why it is an unbalanced force, not just stating the right answer.
Use of proximity as you are teaching the lesson, using your space.
Stand up, hands up, pair up! Fun and creative way to partner them up!
Zip it, lock it, put it in your pocket. Great cooperative learning activity. Countdown to being ready; quick and smooth transitions.
Great job resetting after multiple warnings with student. "I will wait" while they are talking.
Gave specific feedback to the students when you were walking around working one-on-one with students.
Differentiation: You don't need to spell just draw. Restating the directions.
Suggestions:
Set the expectation for students to not be talking while you are. Use that positive praise throughout to set the behavioral expectations.
Modeled what the independent practice looks like.
Set the boundary for not arguing with you about what you said or did not say."""
