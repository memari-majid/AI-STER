# Utah Core Standards Lesson Plan - Demo

**Teacher:** Sarah Johnson  
**Date:** March 15, 2024  
**School:** Mountain View Elementary  
**Subject:** Mathematics  
**Grade:** 3rd Grade  
**Class Size:** 24 students  

## Utah Core Standards
- **3.NBT.1**: Use place value understanding to round whole numbers to the nearest 10 or 100
- **3.NBT.2**: Fluently add and subtract within 1,000 using strategies and algorithms

## Learning Objectives
Students will be able to:
- Understand place value concepts for hundreds, tens, and ones
- Round numbers to the nearest 10 and 100
- Apply rounding strategies in real-world contexts

## Materials
- Base-10 blocks
- Place value charts
- Interactive whiteboard
- Student whiteboards
- Assessment rubric

## Lesson Activities

### Opening (10 minutes)
Hook: Present the question "If our school has 247 students, about how many students is that?"
Students discuss in pairs their thinking about "about how many."

### Direct Instruction (15 minutes)
- Model rounding using base-10 blocks and place value charts
- Demonstrate the rounding rules for tens and hundreds places
- Use Utah Core Standards aligned examples

### Guided Practice (20 minutes)
Students work in collaborative groups to round various numbers
Teacher circulates providing feedback and support

### Independent Practice (10 minutes)
Individual practice problems on student whiteboards
Exit ticket assessment

## Assessment
- Formative: Observation during group work
- Summative: Exit ticket with rounding problems
- Self-assessment: Students rate their confidence level

## Differentiation
- **Advanced learners**: Round to nearest thousand
- **Struggling learners**: Additional manipulative support
- **ELL students**: Visual vocabulary cards

## Utah Education Network Resources
- UEN Mathematics portal activities
- Interactive rounding games
- Virtual manipulatives

This lesson aligns with Utah State Board of Education standards and promotes student understanding through hands-on learning.
