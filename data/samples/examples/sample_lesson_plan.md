# Sample Lesson Plan - 5th Grade Mathematics
**Student Teacher**: [Name]  
**Subject**: Mathematics  
**Grade Level**: 5th Grade  
**Duration**: 45 minutes  
**Date**: [Date]

## Utah Core Standards Alignment
- **Standard 5.NBT.1**: Recognize that in a multi-digit number, a digit in one place represents 10 times as much as it represents in the place to its right
- **Standard 5.NBT.2**: Explain patterns in the number of zeros when multiplying by powers of 10

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Identify place value relationships in multi-digit numbers
2. Explain how digits shift when multiplying by powers of 10
3. Apply place value understanding to solve real-world problems

## Success Criteria
Students will demonstrate understanding by:
- Correctly identifying place values in given numbers
- Explaining the pattern when multiplying by 10, 100, and 1000
- Solving at least 3 out of 4 practice problems independently

## Materials
- Place value charts
- Base-10 blocks
- Interactive whiteboard
- Student worksheets
- Exit tickets

## Lesson Structure

### Opening (5 minutes)
- **Hook**: "If I have $23 and someone gives me 10 times that amount, how much money do I have?"
- **Review**: Quick review of place value positions
- **Learning Objectives**: Share what students will learn today

### Introduction (10 minutes)
- **Direct Instruction**: Using base-10 blocks to show place value relationships
- **Modeling**: Demonstrate how multiplying by 10 shifts digits one place to the left
- **Think-Aloud**: Verbalize the pattern students should notice

### Guided Practice (15 minutes)
- **Interactive Examples**: Work through problems together using place value charts
- **Student Participation**: Have students come to the board to demonstrate
- **Questioning**: Use probing questions to deepen understanding
  - "What do you notice about the digits when we multiply by 100?"
  - "How is this similar to what happened when we multiplied by 10?"

### Independent Practice (10 minutes)
- **Worksheet**: Students complete practice problems in pairs
- **Differentiation**: 
  - Advanced students receive challenge problems with decimals
  - Struggling students work with smaller numbers and additional manipulatives
- **Monitoring**: Circulate to provide individual feedback

### Closure (5 minutes)
- **Exit Ticket**: One problem demonstrating the day's learning
- **Reflection**: Students share one thing they learned
- **Preview**: Connect to tomorrow's lesson on dividing by powers of 10

## Assessment
- **Formative**: Observation during guided practice, questioning, exit ticket
- **Summative**: Performance on independent practice worksheet

## Differentiation Strategies
- **Visual Learners**: Place value charts and manipulatives
- **Kinesthetic Learners**: Physical movement with base-10 blocks
- **Advanced Learners**: Extension problems with decimals
- **English Language Learners**: Visual supports and peer partnerships
- **Students with Disabilities**: Modified worksheets with fewer problems

## Classroom Management
- **Positive Behavior Support**: Praise specific behaviors ("I like how you explained your thinking")
- **Engagement Strategies**: Think-pair-share, random calling, movement
- **Procedures**: Clear expectations for materials distribution and group work

## Real-World Connections
- **Money**: Salary increases, savings growth
- **Measurement**: Converting between units (meters to centimeters)
- **Population**: Understanding large numbers in context

## Technology Integration
- Interactive whiteboard for visual demonstrations
- Document camera for sharing student work
- Online place value game for early finishers
