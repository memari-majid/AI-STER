# AI Lesson Plan Analysis - Issue Resolution

## Issue Summary
You reported seeing "AI Confident 0.0%" when analyzing lesson plans. This indicated the AI was attempting to analyze your lesson plan but encountering technical difficulties.

## How AI Lesson Plan Analysis Works
The AI analyzes uploaded lesson plans to automatically extract key information such as:
- Teacher name and lesson details
- Subject area and grade level
- Learning objectives and materials
- Utah Core Standards alignment
- Assessment methods

The confidence score (0-100%) reflects how successfully the AI extracted this information from your document.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the AI model `gpt-5-mini` returning empty responses during analysis, which caused the system to show 0.0% confidence even though the AI was working.

## Resolution
I've implemented several improvements:

1. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Better detection and reporting of AI analysis issues
2. **Dynamic Confidence Calculation**: Confidence scores now reflect actual extraction success
3. **Improved User Feedback**: Clear warnings when extraction is limited
4. **Debug Tools**: Added troubleshooting information in Settings

## Action Required
To fully resolve the issue, please update your `.env` file:

**Change this line:**
```
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-5-mini
```

**To:**
```
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
```

After making this change and restarting the application, the AI lesson plan analysis will work correctly with accurate confidence scores.

## What You'll See Now
- ‚úÖ Clear success messages when analysis works
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Helpful warnings when extraction is limited
- üìä Accurate confidence percentages based on actual extraction
- üêõ Debug information in Settings if issues occur

The AI lesson plan analysis feature is now more robust and will provide reliable results for your student teaching evaluations.
