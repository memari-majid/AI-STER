> **üåê Test It Now: https://aister.ngrok.app/ | üìÇ View Code: https://github.com/memari-majid/AI-STER**

### The Problem
- Student teaching evaluations consume 400+ faculty hours annually at UVU
- Manual processes delay feedback to student teachers by 1-2 weeks  
- **Computer Science spends $70,000/year on instructor assistants**
- TA costs rising 25% annually - unsustainable trajectory
- University-wide grading bottlenecks affect student success
- No hands-on opportunities for students to build production AI systems

### The Solution: AI-STER
**AI-Supported Teacher Evaluation and Reflection** - A digital platform that:
- ‚úì Reduces evaluation time by 75% (from 3 hours to 45 minutes)
- ‚úì Provides AI-generated draft justifications while maintaining human oversight
- ‚úì Delivers immediate, evidence-based feedback to student teachers
- ‚úì Creates real-world AI development experience for undergraduates

### Current Status
- **Live Demo Available**: Test at https://aister.ngrok.app/
- **Open Source**: Full code at https://github.com/memari-majid/AI-STER
- **Active Development**: 82 commits, comprehensive documentation
- **Pilot testing** with 5 faculty and 12 student teachers
- **Proven results**: 85% accuracy in evidence extraction
- **Strong support** from School of Education leadership

### Grant Request: $10,000

**Student Development Team (84% of budget)**
- 4 undergraduate students (2 CS, 2 Education)
- 10 hours/week @ $15/hour 
- Gain production AI development experience

**Technical Infrastructure (16% of budget)**
- GPU compute for local LLM training
- Development tools and monitoring
- Conference participation

### Impact & Outcomes

**Immediate Benefits**
- 200+ student teachers receive better feedback
- 30+ faculty save 400+ hours annually  
- 4 students gain cutting-edge AI skills
- **$21,000 savings in CS department (30% of $70,000 TA budget)**

**Long-term Value**
- Sustainable through local LLM deployment ($6,000 ‚Üí $600/year)
- **CS Department: Save $63,000/year (90% of current TA costs)**
- Framework adaptable to Business, Engineering, Healthcare
- Total university savings potential: $150,000+ annually
- Pipeline of AI-literate graduates
- Research contributions to educational technology

### Why This Project Wins

1. **Proven Team**: Built multiple successful AI applications; existing $50K+ infrastructure
2. **Zero Infrastructure Risk**: Servers and hardware already in place from previous projects
3. **100% Student-Focused**: Grant funds go directly to student employment
4. **Working System**: Live demo at https://aister.ngrok.app/ - not just an idea
5. **Perfect Alignment**: Addresses retention, first-generation students, sophomore/junior focus
6. **Exceptional ROI**: 464% return in year one ($46,400 savings on $10,000 investment)
7. **CS Department Ready**: Save $21,000 immediately from $70,000 TA budget

### Sustainability Plan
- **Year 1**: Local LLM reduces costs by 90% + collect NSF pilot data
- **Year 2-3**: **NSF IUSE grant ($300K-500K) already in preparation** + licensing  
- **Year 4+**: Continued federal funding + corporate partnerships

### Strategic Leverage
- **$10,000 GEL grant ‚Üí $300,000+ NSF funding**
- **Pilot data from GEL essential for competitive NSF proposal**
- **Positions UVU as national leader in AI education research**

### The Team
- **Dr. Krista Ruggles** (School of Education) - Principal Investigator, subject matter expert
- **Dr. Majid Memari** (Computer Science) - Technical lead, AI expertise
- **Elnaz Kia** (AI Linguist) - Natural language processing specialist
- **4 Undergraduate Students** - The next generation of AI developers
