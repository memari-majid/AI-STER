## üìà The Leverage Effect

### Your $10,000 GEL Investment:

**Year 1 Returns:**
- $46,400 in direct savings
- 4 trained student researchers
- Pilot data for NSF proposal
- Published conference paper

**Year 2-4 Returns (via NSF):**
- $300,000-500,000 federal funding
- 3 PhD students funded
- 12 undergrad research positions
- National research visibility
- Multi-institution collaboration

**Total Leverage: 30-50x Return**

## üî¨ NSF Research Questions

### Primary Research Questions:
1. How does AI-assisted evaluation impact assessment quality and consistency?
2. What is the optimal human-AI collaboration model for educational assessment?
3. How does faster feedback affect student learning outcomes in STEM?
4. Can AI reduce bias in competency-based evaluation?

### Research Design:
- **Control Group**: Traditional evaluation methods
- **Treatment Group**: AI-assisted evaluation
- **Metrics**: Time savings, consistency scores, student outcomes
- **Scale**: 1,000+ students across 5 disciplines

## üèÜ Competitive Advantages for NSF

### Why UVU Will Win NSF Funding:

1. **First Mover**: Few universities have working AI assessment systems
2. **Real Data**: Not theoretical - actual usage statistics
3. **Cost Savings**: Demonstrated $70,000 reduction in TA costs
4. **Interdisciplinary**: CS + Education + STEM departments
5. **Scalability**: Framework applies across all disciplines

### What Other Universities Lack:
- Working prototype
- Pilot data
- Proven cost savings
- Student development experience
- Cross-department buy-in

## üìÖ Timeline to NSF

### With GEL Funding:
- **Months 1-6**: Scale system, collect data
- **Months 7-9**: Analyze results, publish findings
- **Months 10-12**: Prepare NSF proposal
- **Month 13**: Submit NSF IUSE proposal
- **Month 18**: NSF funding begins

### Without GEL Funding:
- Cannot collect sufficient pilot data
- No preliminary results for proposal
- NSF submission delayed 1-2 years
- Lost opportunity for federal funding

## üéì Student Research Opportunities

### GEL-Funded Students Become:
- Co-authors on NSF proposal
- Published researchers (conference papers)
- Experienced in federal grant process
- Candidates for NSF-funded PhD positions

### Research Topics for Students:
- Machine learning in educational assessment
- Human-computer interaction in grading
- Bias detection in AI evaluation
- Natural language processing for feedback

## üí∞ Budget Alignment

### How GEL Spending Supports NSF:
- **Student Training**: Creates research team
- **Infrastructure**: Proves scalability
- **Documentation**: Required for NSF proposal
- **Conference Travel**: Dissemination of results

### NSF Budget Preview:
- Personnel (60%): $180,000-300,000
- Equipment (10%): $30,000-50,000
- Travel (5%): $15,000-25,000
- Indirect (25%): $75,000-125,000

## üìä Success Metrics for NSF

### What We'll Show NSF:
1. **Efficiency**: 75% time reduction (proven)
2. **Cost Savings**: $70,000/year in one department
3. **Adoption**: 200+ users in first year
4. **Quality**: 85% AI accuracy rate
5. **Satisfaction**: 90%+ user approval

### Research Publications Plan:
- SIGCSE 2025: "AI-Assisted Evaluation in Teacher Education"
- AERA 2025: "Reducing Bias Through AI Assessment"
- IEEE Education: "Scaling AI Grading Systems"
- Journal of Ed Tech: "Cost-Benefit Analysis of AI in Higher Ed"

## üöÄ The Multiplier Effect

### $10,000 GEL Grant Leads To:
1. **$46,400** Year 1 savings
2. **$300,000+** NSF funding
3. **$440,000** 5-year TA savings
4. **$500,000+** licensing revenue potential
5. **$1,000,000+** total economic impact

## ‚úÖ Risk Mitigation

### Why This Strategy Will Succeed:
- **Proven Team**: Multiple successful grants
- **Working System**: Not speculative
- **Clear Need**: $70,000 problem to solve
- **Federal Priority**: AI in education
- **Strong Preliminary Data**: GEL enables this

## üéØ Call to Action
