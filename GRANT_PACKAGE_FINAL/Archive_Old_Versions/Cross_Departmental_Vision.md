# AI-STER: Cross-Departmental Vision for AI-Powered Assessment

## Executive Summary

While AI-STER began as a solution for student teacher evaluations, its competency-based assessment framework has profound implications for addressing university-wide challenges. With departments across UVU facing instructor assistant shortages and rising costs, AI-STER's approach offers a scalable, sustainable solution.

## The University-Wide Challenge

### Current State:
- **40% TA Shortage** in Computer Science Department
- **25% Annual Cost Increase** for instructor assistants
- **15-20 Hours/Week** faculty spend on grading
- **Inconsistent Feedback** due to varying TA availability
- **Growing Enrollment** without proportional funding

### The Opportunity:
Transform assessment from a bottleneck into a learning accelerator through AI-powered assistance.

## AI-STER Framework: Beyond Teacher Education

### Core Principles:
1. **Competency-Based**: Define clear learning outcomes and assessment criteria
2. **AI-Assisted, Human-Centered**: AI drafts, humans decide
3. **Evidence-Based**: Link feedback to specific student work
4. **Scalable**: Local LLM deployment for cost efficiency
5. **Adaptable**: Framework customizes to any discipline

## Department-Specific Applications

### Computer Science Department (In Development)
**Challenge**: Grading programming assignments with limited TAs
**Solution**: AI-powered code review and feedback system
- Evaluate code quality, efficiency, and documentation
- Check for common errors and suggest improvements
- Assess algorithm implementation and optimization
- Provide consistent feedback across all sections
**Impact**: Save 200+ hours per semester, improve feedback turnaround

### Business School (Planned)
**Applications**:
- Case study analysis evaluation
- Business plan assessment
- Financial modeling feedback
- Presentation skills evaluation
**Unique Features**: Industry-specific language models, strategic thinking assessment

### Engineering (Proposed)
**Applications**:

- Safety compliance checking
- Innovation assessment
**Benefits**: Standardized evaluation across complex projects

### Healthcare Programs (Future)
**Applications**:
- Clinical skills assessment
- Patient interaction evaluation
- Care plan development feedback
- Competency milestone tracking
**Advantages**: Consistent evaluation of soft skills and technical knowledge

### Arts & Humanities (Exploratory)
**Potential Uses**:
- Creative writing feedback
- Art portfolio assessment
- Performance evaluation
- Critical analysis papers
**Innovation**: AI understanding of creative expression and critique

## Implementation Roadmap

- Integration with LMS systems

## Financial Impact

### Cost Savings by Department (Projected Annual):
- Computer Science: $40,000 (TA hours)
- Business: $35,000 (grading support)
- Engineering: $30,000 (project evaluation)
- Education: $25,000 (evaluation time)
- **Total: $130,000+ annually**

### Revenue Generation:
- License to other universities: $5,000-10,000/department
- Consulting for implementation: $25,000/institution
- Research grants: $300,000+ (NSF, DOE)

## Student Benefits Across Disciplines

### For Student Developers:
- Experience building enterprise-scale AI systems
- Cross-functional collaboration skills
- Portfolio demonstrating real impact
- Preparation for AI-driven job market

### For All Students:
- Faster feedback (24-48 hours vs. 1-2 weeks)
- More detailed, actionable comments
- Consistent evaluation standards
- Better learning outcomes

## Research Opportunities

### Academic Publications:
- "Competency-Based AI Assessment Across Disciplines"
- "Reducing Grading Burden Through Responsible AI"
- "Student Outcomes with AI-Assisted Feedback"

### Grant Opportunities:
- NSF IUSE: AI in STEM Education ($300,000)
- Department of Education: Innovation in Assessment ($500,000)
- Private Foundations: Future of Higher Education ($250,000)

## Why Start with Education?

1. **Clear Standards**: USBE requirements provide structured framework
2. **Willing Partners**: Education faculty embrace innovation
3. **Measurable Impact**: Direct correlation to teacher quality
4. **Transferable Model**: Competency-based approach applies everywhere

## Call to Action

The $10,000 GEL grant investment in AI-STER will:
1. Create proven infrastructure for university-wide use
2. Train students who can lead AI adoption across departments
3. Generate research validating the approach
4. Position UVU as a national leader in AI-powered education

## The Vision

By 2027, UVU will be recognized as the premier institution for responsible AI implementation in higher education, with:
- Every department benefiting from AI-assisted assessment
- Students graduating with hands-on AI experience
- Faculty freed to focus on teaching and mentoring
- A sustainable model replicated nationwide
