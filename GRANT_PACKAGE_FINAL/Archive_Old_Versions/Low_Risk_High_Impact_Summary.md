## üí∞ Financial Risk Mitigation

### Traditional Grant Risks:
- ‚ùå "Will the technology work?" - **Already working**
- ‚ùå "Will they deliver on time?" - **Already delivered POC**
- ‚ùå "Will infrastructure costs overrun?" - **Already have infrastructure**
- ‚ùå "Will adoption happen?" - **Already being adopted**

### Where Your Money Goes:
- **84%**: Student wages (direct educational impact)
- **8%**: Cloud services for LLM training
- **8%**: Development tools and conferences

### ROI Timeline:
- **Month 1**: Students productive immediately (no setup time)
- **Month 3**: Local LLM reduces costs by 90%
- **Month 6**: CS Department saves $10,500 (15% efficiency gain)
- **Month 12**: $46,400 total savings achieved
- **Year 2**: $88,400 annual savings with full implementation

### The CS Department Opportunity:
- **Current State**: $70,000 annual TA budget
- **Year 1 Target**: 30% efficiency = $21,000 savings
- **Long-term Goal**: 90% automation = $63,000 annual savings
- **Quality Benefit**: More consistent grading than rotating TAs

## üéì Student Success Guaranteed

### Why Students Will Succeed:
1. **Clear Project Scope**: Not starting from scratch
2. **Existing Mentorship**: Faculty with AI experience
3. **Working Codebase**: Professional development environment
4. **Real Users**: Immediate feedback and validation

### Student Outcomes:
- Build on production system (not toy project)
- Work with cutting-edge AI (LLMs, local deployment)
- Create real impact (help 200+ student teachers)
- Develop marketable skills (average starting salary: $95K+)
