# AI-STER: A Strategic $10,000 Investment with 50x Return Potential

## The Opportunity Cascade

### Your $10,000 Investment Triggers:

1. **Immediate Returns (Year 1)**
   - $46,400 in direct savings (464% ROI)
   - $21,000 CS department TA cost reduction
   - $20,000 faculty time savings in Education
   - $5,400 API cost reduction

2. **NSF Funding (Year 2-4)**
   - $300,000-500,000 NSF IUSE grant
   - **Already preparing proposal**
   - GEL provides essential pilot data
   - 30-50x leverage on your investment

3. **Long-term Impact (Year 2+)**
   - $88,400 annual savings
   - $440,000 five-year total
   - Framework scales university-wide
   - National research recognition

## Why This is Different

### Not Your Typical Grant Request:
- ✅ **Live System**: https://aister.ngrok.app/ (test it now!)
- ✅ **Proven Team**: 3 successful AI apps already built
- ✅ **Infrastructure Ready**: $50K+ servers in place
- ✅ **Immediate Problem**: $70,000 CS TA costs
- ✅ **NSF Pipeline**: Major grant in preparation

### The Strategic Play:
**GEL Grant** → **Pilot Data** → **NSF Proposal** → **$500K Federal Funding**

## The Numbers Don't Lie

| Investment | Return | Multiple |
|------------|--------|----------|
| $10,000 GEL | $46,400 Year 1 | 4.6x |
| $10,000 GEL | $300,000+ NSF | 30x+ |
| $10,000 GEL | $440,000 5-year | 44x |

## Critical Timeline

### With GEL Funding:
- **Jan-June 2025**: Scale system, collect data
- **July-Sept 2025**: Analyze results, publish
- **Oct-Dec 2025**: Submit NSF proposal
- **Jan 2026**: NSF funding begins

### Without GEL Funding:
- No pilot data for NSF
- Delay federal funding 2+ years
- Lose first-mover advantage
- Continue bleeding $70,000/year on TAs

## The Team is Ready

- **Dr. Majid Memari**: Multiple successful AI implementations
- **Dr. Krista Ruggles**: Education assessment expert
- **Infrastructure**: $50K+ in servers ready
- **Students**: Waiting to build the future

## Three Reasons to Fund This NOW

1. **CS Department Crisis**: $70,000 TA costs rising 25% annually
2. **NSF Window**: Proposal deadline approaching, need pilot data
3. **Competition**: Other universities pursuing similar solutions

## The Ask

**Fund**: $10,000 (100% to student wages)

**Get**:
- $46,400 immediate savings
- $300,000+ NSF funding potential
- National research leadership
- Solution to $70,000 problem

## The Decision is Simple

This isn't really a grant decision. It's a business decision:

**Option A**: Invest $10,000, save $440,000+, secure federal funding
**Option B**: Do nothing, watch costs spiral, miss NSF opportunity

## One Final Thought

Every month we delay:
- Costs increase $1,458 (TA budget growth)
- Students miss AI experience
- NSF advantage erodes
- Other universities advance

**The question isn't whether to fund AI-STER.**
**The question is whether UVU wants to lead or follow.**
