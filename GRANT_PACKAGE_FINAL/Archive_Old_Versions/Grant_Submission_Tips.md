## üí° Talking Points for Meetings/Presentations

### For Skeptics About AI in Education:
"AI-STER keeps humans in control - it's an assistant, not a replacement. Supervisors maintain all decision-making authority while AI handles the time-consuming documentation."

### For Budget Concerns:
"The $10,000 investment saves $46,400 in the first year alone - that's a 464% ROI. The CS department currently spends $70,000 on TAs. We can reduce that by $21,000 in year one, and by $63,000 long-term. This grant pays for itself in less than 3 months."

### For Sustainability Questions:
"We're moving from expensive cloud APIs to efficient local models, reducing costs by 90%. Plus, we're building revenue streams through licensing to other universities."

### For Student Impact:
"These aren't just student workers - they're apprentice developers learning to build the AI systems that will define the next decade of technology."

### For Cross-Departmental Value:
"AI-STER's framework isn't just for teacher evaluations - we're already planning to adapt it for the Computer Science department's grading needs, addressing the 40% TA shortage. This $10,000 investment creates infrastructure that could save the university $100,000+ annually in TA costs across departments."

### For Risk Assessment:
"This is an exceptionally low-risk grant. We've successfully built several AI applications before, we already have $50,000+ in server infrastructure from previous projects, and the proof of concept is live at aister.ngrok.app. The grant funds go 100% to student employment - we're not asking for equipment or hoping something might work. We just need students to scale what's already proven."

### For Strategic Impact:
"This $10,000 GEL grant is strategic seed funding for our NSF IUSE proposal currently in preparation. NSF requires pilot data and preliminary results - this GEL grant provides exactly that. You're not just funding a project, you're positioning UVU to receive $300,000-500,000 in federal research funding. That's a 30-50x return on investment."

## üéØ Final Pitch

"AI-STER transforms a critical but burdensome process while creating an innovative learning laboratory. For $10,000, UVU gains a sustainable evaluation system, develops AI-literate graduates, and leads responsible AI adoption in education. This isn't just funding an app - it's investing in the future of both educational technology and our students' careers."
