## Project Title
AI-STER: Scaling AI-Supported Teacher Evaluation Through Student Innovation

## Project Abstract Statement (250-300 words)

AI-STER (AI-Supported Teacher Evaluation and Reflection) is a groundbreaking digital platform that streamlines the student teaching evaluation process while providing critical hands-on experience for computer science and education students. Currently in pilot testing with subject matter experts in the School of Education, AI-STER has demonstrated significant potential to reduce evaluation time by 75% while improving feedback quality for student teachers.

This project will hire and train 4 undergraduate students (2 computer science, 2 education) to maintain, improve, and scale the platform while gaining invaluable real-world experience building production AI applications. Students will implement critical features including local LLM deployment to reduce operational costs by 90%, mobile application development, advanced analytics dashboards, and integration with university systems.

The project directly addresses UVU priorities by improving student teacher retention through better feedback mechanisms, supporting first-generation college students with clearer evaluation processes, and creating an innovative learning laboratory where students build cutting-edge AI applications. Computer science students will master full-stack development, AI/ML implementation, and DevOps practices, while education students will contribute to UI/UX design and pedagogical alignment, ensuring the tool meets real classroom needs.

Expected outcomes include: a fully operational evaluation platform serving 200+ student teachers annually, comprehensive documentation enabling other institutions to adopt the system, 4 students with advanced AI development skills ready for industry positions, and a sustainable model using local LLM infrastructure. The framework developed will be adaptable to other departments facing similar assessment challenges, including the Computer Science department's initiative to address the growing TA shortage through AI-powered grading assistance. This interdisciplinary collaboration will establish UVU as a leader in responsible AI implementation across higher education while providing transformative professional experiences for our students.

## Project Introduction

The evaluation of student teachers represents a critical juncture in educator preparation, yet current processes remain mired in inefficient, paper-based systems that provide inconsistent feedback and consume excessive faculty time. At Utah Valley University, our School of Education supervises over 200 student teachers annually, with each evaluation requiring 2-3 hours of documentation and justification writing. This administrative burden reduces time available for meaningful mentoring and contributes to evaluator fatigue.

AI-STER transforms this process through intelligent automation while maintaining human oversight and pedagogical integrity. Our pilot testing has shown that supervisors can complete comprehensive evaluations in under 30 minutes while providing richer, evidence-based feedback. The platform aligns with Utah State Board of Education standards and has received enthusiastic support from early faculty testers.

This grant will elevate AI-STER from a promising prototype to a production-ready system by engaging undergraduate students as core developers and maintainers. This approach serves dual purposes: advancing the platform's capabilities while providing unparalleled learning opportunities for students to build real-world AI applications. In an era where AI literacy is becoming essential across disciplines, this project positions UVU students at the forefront of educational technology innovation.

The interdisciplinary nature of this projectâ€”bridging Computer Science and Educationâ€”creates unique synergies. Computer science students gain experience with stakeholder-driven development and user-centered design, while education students contribute pedagogical expertise and ensure the tool genuinely serves teacher development needs. This collaboration models the kind of cross-functional teamwork increasingly valued in modern workplaces.

## Project Statement of Need

### The Magnitude of the Problem

Student teaching evaluation represents one of the most time-intensive processes in teacher preparation programs. Current statistics reveal the scope of this challenge:

- **Time Investment**: Each evaluation requires 2-3 hours for completion, with supervisors managing 8-12 student teachers per semester
- **Inconsistency**: Without standardized tools, evaluation quality varies significantly between supervisors, creating inequitable experiences for student teachers
- **Delayed Feedback**: Manual processes often result in 1-2 week delays in feedback delivery, missing critical teachable moments
- **Limited Data**: Paper-based systems prevent longitudinal analysis of student progress and program effectiveness

### Root Causes

The current evaluation system's inefficiencies stem from:
1. **Outdated Infrastructure**: Reliance on PDF forms and manual data entry
2. **Cognitive Load**: Supervisors must simultaneously observe, take notes, and mentally map observations to 35+ rubric criteria
3. **Justification Burden**: Writing detailed, evidence-based justifications for each score is cognitively demanding and time-consuming
4. **Lack of Integration**: No connection between lesson plans, observations, and evaluations

### Broader University Challenge

This evaluation burden extends across UVU:
- **TA Crisis**: Computer Science currently spends $70,000 annually on instructor assistants
- **Rising Costs**: TA expenses increasing 25% annually, unsustainable trajectory
- **Grading Bottlenecks**: Faculty spend 15-20 hours/week on assignment grading
- **Inconsistent Feedback**: TA availability and quality varies by semester
- **Scalability Issues**: Growing enrollment without proportional TA funding

### The CS Department Opportunity

The Computer Science department's $70,000 annual TA budget presents an immediate opportunity for AI-STER's framework:
- **Phase 1**: Increase TA efficiency with AI assistance (30% cost reduction = $21,000 savings)
- **Phase 2**: Reduce TA positions while maintaining quality (50% reduction = $35,000 savings)
- **Phase 3**: Transition to AI-powered grading with faculty oversight (90% reduction = $63,000 savings)

### Why This Goal is Realistic and Attainable

Our pilot testing demonstrates clear feasibility:
- **Live Demo Available Now**: https://aister.ngrok.app/ - Test it yourself!
- **Open Source Code**: https://github.com/memari-majid/AI-STER - Full transparency
- Successfully tested with 5 faculty members and 12 student teachers
- AI accuracy rate of 85% for extracting relevant evidence from lesson plans
- Positive feedback from early adopters citing significant time savings
- **GitHub Activity**: 82 commits, active development, comprehensive documentation

### Long-term Effects

Successful implementation will:
- Free 400+ hours annually for faculty to focus on mentoring rather than paperwork
- Improve student teacher retention through timely, actionable feedback
- Create a replicable model for AI-assisted evaluation in education
- Develop a pipeline of AI-literate graduates prepared for the evolving job market
