## Meeting Agenda & Timeline

### üéØ **Opening & Context Setting** (5 minutes) - 0:00-0:05

**SCRIPT:**
> "Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. I'm excited to share the significant progress we've made on the AI-STER system since our last meeting. 
>
> Today's agenda covers three key areas: First, we'll demonstrate the major improvements we've implemented, particularly around lesson plan quality and user experience. Second, I'll share validation data showing how we've achieved real-world alignment. Finally, we'll discuss our roadmap for the next phase of development.
>
> This should take about 45 minutes with 15 minutes for questions and discussion. Does that work for everyone?"

### üìä **Progress Summary** (8 minutes) - 0:05-0:13

**SCRIPT:**
> "Let me start with a high-level overview of what we've accomplished in the past [timeframe]:

**Key Achievements Slide:**

   - Highlight visual consistency with competencies

2. **AI-Powered Features**
   - Show observation notes guidance
   - Demonstrate bulk justification generation
   - Display evidence-based scoring suggestions

**SCRIPT:**
> "We've standardized the interface so evaluators have the same professional experience whether they're scoring competencies or dispositions. The AI now generates justifications based on actual observation notes, making the process both faster and more evidence-based."

#### **Demo Section 3: Analytics & Insights** (5 minutes)

**SCRIPT:**
> "Finally, let me show you the analytics capabilities we've built."

**Demo Flow:**

   - Export evaluation data
   - Show summary reports
   - Highlight compliance tracking

### üìà **Validation Results** (7 minutes) - 0:33-0:40

**SCRIPT:**
> "Now let me share the data that validates these improvements."

**Validation Metrics Slide:**
- **Standards Alignment**: 12/13 real standards now covered (92.3% vs 30.8%)
- **Content Quality**: Average lesson plan length increased from 500 to 2,485 characters
- **Professional Format**: 100% Utah DOE template compliance
- **User Testing**: [Include any user feedback if available]
- **System Performance**: [Include technical metrics]

**SCRIPT:**
> "These numbers represent a fundamental shift from synthetic-looking content to professional, authentic materials that match what evaluators expect to see in real classroom settings."

### üõ£Ô∏è **Future Roadmap** (10 minutes) - 0:40-0:50

**SCRIPT:**
> "Based on our progress and your initial requirements, here's what we're proposing for the next development phase."

#### **Phase 2 Priorities (Next 3 months)**

**SCRIPT:**
> "We've identified four key areas for Phase 2 development:

**Slide: Phase 2 Roadmap**
