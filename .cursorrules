## 📄 Document Thoughtfully
- **Document reasoning, not just code.** Before writing code, capture context, assumptions, and why a change matters.
- **Update docs in real time.** If behavior changes, immediately reflect it in README, design docs, or inline comments.

## 🧹 Keep the Repo Tidy
- **Organize folders logically.** Group related files—don't let dead code or drafts linger.
- **Refactor when you're there.** Touch the messy bits nearby and clean them up; never introduce more tech‑debt.

## 🎯 Plan First, Then Execute
- **Lock to the plan or update it.** If you need to pivot, edit the plan first—don't improvise.
- **Review the plan frequently.** Ask: Are we on target? Do priorities or assumptions still hold?

## 🧱 Progress in Small Steps
- **Make atomic commits.** Break work into independent, testable units.
- **Test continuously.** Add or update tests alongside code changes to validate behavior.

## 📝 Log Decisions & Learning
- **Track architectural choices.** Record key decisions, trade-offs, alternatives.
- **Harvest lessons.** At session end, run a brief `retro` to note what worked, what failed, and update rules if needed.
