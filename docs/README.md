## 1. Project Overview

_(This content was formerly the root `README.md`)_

AI-STER is a web-based application designed to streamline the evaluation of student teachers by leveraging AI to assist with generating standards-aligned feedback. It implements the Utah State Board of Education (USBE) Student Teacher Evaluation Rubric (STER).

### âœ¨ Features

- **Comprehensive Evaluation:** Covers all 9 STER indicators, 8 field evaluation items, and 6 professional dispositions.
- **AI-Powered Feedback:** Uses OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini to generate smart, context-aware justifications for evaluations.
- **Compliance Validation:** Ensures all required fields and standards are met before submission.
- **Data Portability:** Easy JSON-based import and export of evaluation data.
- **No Database Needed:** Runs locally with simple JSON file storage.
