## 🏗 **Current Project Status**

### **Phase 1: Core Functionality (In Progress)**
- ✅ Basic evaluation system implemented
- 🔄 AI justification workflow being updated
- ⏳ Disposition comment boxes pending
- ⏳ Rubric quick-access pending

### **Upcoming Phases**
- **Phase 2**: Evaluation Management (Weeks 5-8)
- **Phase 3**: Data Infrastructure (Weeks 9-12)
- **Phase 4**: System Integration (Weeks 13-16)

## 🔧 **Key Components**

### **Evaluation System**
- **Field Evaluations**: 8 assessment items for 3-week experiences
- **STER Evaluations**: Comprehensive formative and summative tracking system (35 total items)
  - **Supervisor Items**: 19 competencies (LL2-LL7, IC1/IC2, IC3, IC4, IC5/IC6, IC7, IP1-IP8)
  - **Cooperating Teacher Items**: 16 competencies (LL1, CC1-CC8, PR1-PR7)
  - **Combined Competencies**: IC1/IC2 and IC5/IC6 evaluated as single items
  - **Role-Based Access**: Cream rows (cooperating teachers) vs white rows (supervisors)
  - **Progress Tracking**: Automatic monitoring of student evaluation completion
  - **Smart Selection**: Completed evaluations grayed out to prevent errors
- **Professional Dispositions**: 6 USBE-required dispositions
- **AI Integration**: Evidence extraction and analysis

### **Workflow Overview**
1. **Observation**: Supervisor documents classroom observation
2. **AI Analysis**: System extracts evidence from lesson plans and notes
3. **Review**: Supervisor reviews AI-generated justifications
4. **Scoring**: Informed scoring based on observations + AI insights
5. **Finalization**: Complete with dispositions and validation

## 🎓 **USBE Compliance**

AI-STER implements Utah State Board of Education standards (July 2024):
- All required assessment items and competency areas
- Proper scoring levels (2+ for items, 3+ for dispositions)
- Evidence-based justifications for all scores
- Professional disposition tracking and feedback
