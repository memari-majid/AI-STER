Lesson Plan: Theme and Textual Evidence in Literature

Grade Level: 6th Grade
Content Area: English Language Arts
Duration: 60 minutes

Utah ELA Core Standards Addressed:
- RL.6.2: Determine a theme or central idea of a text and how it is conveyed through particular details; provide a summary of the text distinct from personal opinions or judgments.
- RL.6.1: Cite textual evidence to support analysis of what the text says explicitly as well as inferences drawn from the text.

Learning Intentions (IC2):
Students will be able to determine the theme of a literary passage and cite specific textual evidence to support their analysis.

Success Criteria (IC2):
- I can identify the theme of a story.
- I can find and explain specific evidence in the text that supports my understanding of the theme.

Lesson Sequence:

1. Anticipatory Set (5 minutes)
- Display a quote: "Courage doesn't always roar."
- Quick-write: "What do you think this means?"
- Connect to prior knowledge of themes and morals in stories (LL2, IC4).

2. Direct Instruction (10 minutes)
- Review definition of theme and textual evidence.
- Use an anchor chart to model how to extract theme from a short paragraph.

3. Guided Practice (15 minutes)
- Read aloud the short story "Thank You, Ma'am" by Langston Hughes.
- In pairs, students identify possible themes and highlight textual evidence.

4. Independent Practice (20 minutes)
- Students complete a Theme Tracker graphic organizer for another short passage ("Eleven" by Sandra Cisneros excerpt).
- Students select and explain at least two pieces of textual evidence to support their identified theme.

5. Exit Ticket (5 minutes)
- Students write one theme and one supporting quote from the text they read.

Differentiation Strategies (IP1):
- Provide sentence frames for struggling writers.
- Offer oral/audio versions for ELL students.
- Advanced learners write a paragraph interpreting the author's purpose.

Formative Assessment (IP6):
- Exit tickets
- Informal checks during group/pair work
- Completed graphic organizers

Real-World Connections (LL6):
- Discuss how themes in stories can apply to students' own lives (e.g., perseverance, honesty).

Classroom Climate (CC2, CC3):
- Students will work in pairs with rotating roles to build positive peer interaction.
- Norms for respectful listening and discussion will be reviewed and reinforced.

Technology Integration (IP8):
- Use Google Slides for whole-class modeling.
- Graphic organizer provided via Google Docs or printed.
