## Evaluation Source: STER Rubric

# Student Teaching Evaluation Rubric (STER)
## July 2024

*Aligned with the USBE General Teacher Education Competencies, which were approved June 6, 2024*

### Assessment Guidelines

When used as a summative assessment at the end of the final clinical experience, the expected (i.e., required) level of performance is two (2) or "demonstrates competency at expected level." In addition, when used as a summative assessment, teacher candidates/student teachers are not expected to score a three (3) on any rows of the rubric; however, teacher candidates/student teachers are not succeeding if they score a zero (0) or one (1) on any row of the rubric. Thus, to succeed, the total score must be 70 or higher (minimum of 2 on each item).

**Note:** Some rows of the rubric require a supervisor to consult with the teacher candidate's mentor teacher in order to have sufficient information to assign a level of performance. These rows are marked with the phrase "Conference w/MT." Some rows may also require that the supervisor consult with the teacher candidate/student teacher. These are marked with the phrase "Conference w/ST."

*Approved by USBE, July 18, 2024*

### Scoring Notes

Some row descriptors stack on each other and some do not. For example, in item 1 of the rubric, the "demonstrates competency at expected level" includes the behaviors described under "approaching competency." And to exceed expected level of competency, one must also demonstrate the behaviors listed under both "approaching competency" and "demonstrates competency at expected level." This stacking is indicated using "…and" at the beginning of the descriptor. On the other hand, there are some row descriptors that do not stack on each other. For example, in item 4 of the rubric, there are no "…and" phrases. So, to score a 2, or "demonstrates competency at expected level," only the behaviors listed in that cell must be demonstrated. Finally, there are occasional uses of OR and AND to indicate that either behavior or both behaviors should be demonstrated in order to score at a specific level.

*ADA Compliant: August 2024*

*Developed by a committee consisting of educator preparation faculty from Utah State University, Utah Valley University, University of Utah, Weber State University, Westminster University, Brigham Young University, Southern Utah University, and Utah Tech University.*

### UVU STER Evaluation Notes

Throughout the UVU STER Evaluation form you will find example justification statements when scoring students at a level 2 directly under each rubric item. These examples are intended to assist evaluators as they consider formatting and rubric alignment. These examples are not specific to a classroom; in your justification, please provide examples from the lesson you observed. While a level 2 score indicates the student has met the competency requirement, it is okay to score students at a level 3 with additional justification aligned to the rubric.

- **Cream rows are for cooperating teachers.**
- **White rows are for supervisors**
