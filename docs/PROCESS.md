Formative and Summative Evaluations: Add an option for the system to recognize and differentiate between formative and summative evaluations, including graying out completed formative evaluations. 
Evaluation Type Selection: Ensure the system can track the number of formative assessments for each student teacher and recognize when a summative evaluation is required. 
Dispositions Feedback: Include a comment box under each disposition for supervisors to manually input feedback and suggestions. 
Summative Evaluation Generation: Add an option to generate summative evaluations based on the cumulative scores from formative evaluations. 
Evaluation Report Distribution: Implement a feature to send the completed evaluation report to the student, supervisor, and cooperative teacher via email. 
Rubric Access: Add a link to the actual stir rubric within the interface for supervisors to refer to during evaluations. 
Lesson Plan Requirement: Ensure the system allows supervisors to proceed with evaluations even if a lesson plan is not uploaded, while still encouraging its submission. 

Data Storage - Implement a system to store all evaluations and lesson plans for each student teacher, including both formative and summative evaluations. 

Duration of Data Storage - Ensure the system can store data for the entire accreditation cycle, approximately seven years. 

Replacing Qualtrics - Develop the system to potentially replace Qualtrics by storing all evaluations and lesson plans. Include functionality to download and upload data to Qualtrics if needed. 

Knowledge Base - Utilize a knowledge base to store synthesized data in vector format, compatible with the large language model being used. This knowledge base will be efficient and require minimal storage space. 

Data Synthesis - Implement data synthesis to remove personal information and store it indefinitely as a knowledge base. Maintain a separate regular database to keep original data for retrieval when needed.

## Evaluation Source: STER Rubric

# Student Teaching Evaluation Rubric (STER)
## July 2024

*Aligned with the USBE General Teacher Education Competencies, which were approved June 6, 2024*

### Assessment Guidelines

When used as a summative assessment at the end of the final clinical experience, the expected (i.e., required) level of performance is two (2) or "demonstrates competency at expected level." In addition, when used as a summative assessment, teacher candidates/student teachers are not expected to score a three (3) on any rows of the rubric; however, teacher candidates/student teachers are not succeeding if they score a zero (0) or one (1) on any row of the rubric. Thus, to succeed, the total score must be 70 or higher (minimum of 2 on each item).

**Note:** Some rows of the rubric require a supervisor to consult with the teacher candidate's mentor teacher in order to have sufficient information to assign a level of performance. These rows are marked with the phrase "Conference w/MT." Some rows may also require that the supervisor consult with the teacher candidate/student teacher. These are marked with the phrase "Conference w/ST."

*Approved by USBE, July 18, 2024*

### Scoring Notes

Some row descriptors stack on each other and some do not. For example, in item 1 of the rubric, the "demonstrates competency at expected level" includes the behaviors described under "approaching competency." And to exceed expected level of competency, one must also demonstrate the behaviors listed under both "approaching competency" and "demonstrates competency at expected level." This stacking is indicated using "‚Ä¶and" at the beginning of the descriptor. On the other hand, there are some row descriptors that do not stack on each other. For example, in item 4 of the rubric, there are no "‚Ä¶and" phrases. So, to score a 2, or "demonstrates competency at expected level," only the behaviors listed in that cell must be demonstrated. Finally, there are occasional uses of OR and AND to indicate that either behavior or both behaviors should be demonstrated in order to score at a specific level.

*ADA Compliant: August 2024*

*Developed by a committee consisting of educator preparation faculty from Utah State University, Utah Valley University, University of Utah, Weber State University, Westminster University, Brigham Young University, Southern Utah University, and Utah Tech University.*

### UVU STER Evaluation Notes

Throughout the UVU STER Evaluation form you will find example justification statements when scoring students at a level 2 directly under each rubric item. These examples are intended to assist evaluators as they consider formatting and rubric alignment. These examples are not specific to a classroom; in your justification, please provide examples from the lesson you observed. While a level 2 score indicates the student has met the competency requirement, it is okay to score students at a level 3 with additional justification aligned to the rubric.

- **Cream rows are for cooperating teachers.**
- **White rows are for supervisors**
