# AI Testing Feature - Implementation Summary

## What Was Done

### 1. **Organized Test Data**
- Created `/test_data/` directory with organized structure
- Consolidated 9 test lesson plans with varying confidence levels
- Created `TEST_DATA_CATALOG.json` to manage all test cases
- Removed redundant demo_lesson_plans and test_lesson_plans directories

### 2. **Test Data Categories**
| Category | Expected Confidence | Number of Plans |
|----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| High Confidence | 85-95% | 3 plans |
| Medium Confidence | 70-85% | 2 plans |
| Low Confidence | <30% | 2 plans |
| Demo - Exemplary | 85-95% | 1 plan |
| Demo - Specialized | 80-90% | 1 plan |

### 3. **Integrated AI Testing into App**
- Added new tab "ðŸ¤– AI Confidence Testing" to Test Data page
- Users can now:
  - Select test categories
  - Choose specific lesson plans
  - View expected vs actual confidence
  - See detailed field extraction results
  - Understand which fields passed/failed

### 4. **Test Plans Include**
- **High Quality**: Structured 5th grade math, ESL, Special Ed
- **Medium Quality**: Narrative ELA, Table-format History
- **Low Quality**: Minimal science outline, Generic standards-only
- **Demos**: Secondary English, Early Childhood

## How to Use the Feature

1. Navigate to "ðŸ§ª Test Data" in the app
2. Click on "ðŸ¤– AI Confidence Testing" tab
3. Select a category (or "All" to see everything)
4. Choose a specific lesson plan to test
5. Click "ðŸ¤– Analyze with AI" to run the test
6. Review the results:
   - Actual confidence score
   - Whether it's within expected range
   - Detailed field extraction breakdown

## Benefits

- **Validation**: Verify AI extraction is working correctly
- **Debugging**: Identify which fields fail to extract
- **Benchmarking**: Test against known confidence levels
- **Training**: Show users what formats work best
- **Quality Assurance**: Ensure system performs as expected

## Technical Implementation

- Modified `show_test_data()` function in app.py
- Added tabbed interface for demos and AI testing
- Used existing OpenAI service for analysis
- Created comprehensive test catalog in JSON format
- Displays results in user-friendly tables and metrics

## Next Steps

Users can now:
1. Test the AI with various lesson plan formats
2. Verify the 6.7% confidence issue is reproducible
3. Confirm that well-structured plans achieve 85%+ confidence
4. Use this feature to train new users on proper formatting
5. Debug any AI extraction issues with specific examples

The feature is fully integrated and ready for use!
