- Provide guidance on appropriate evidence and observations
- Demonstrate the expected level of detail in evaluations

**Note**: Evaluators should provide specific examples from observed lessons rather than using generic statements.

## File Formats

- Markdown (.md) files for easy reading and version control
- PDF files for official distribution and printing
- JSON file for programmatic access to competency data
- DOCX file for additional project documentation
