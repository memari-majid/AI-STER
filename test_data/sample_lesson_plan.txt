Lesson Plan: Introduction to Fractions

Grade Level: 3rd Grade
Content Area: Mathematics
Duration: 45 minutes
Teacher: Sarah Johnson
School: Riverside Elementary School
Date: January 15, 2025
Class Size: 24 students

Utah Mathematics Core Standards Addressed:
- 3.NF.1: Understand a fraction 1/b as the quantity formed by 1 part when a whole is partitioned into b equal parts
- 3.NF.3: Explain equivalence of fractions and compare fractions by reasoning about their size

Learning Intentions (IC2):
Students will be able to identify and create fractions using visual models and real-world examples.

Success Criteria (IC2):
- I can identify fractions in visual models and explain what the numerator and denominator represent.
- I can create my own visual representations of fractions using manipulatives or drawings.
- I can explain how fractions relate to equal parts of a whole.

Materials Needed:
- Fraction circles/bars manipulatives
- Paper plates
- Colored markers
- Student worksheets
- Interactive whiteboard
- Exit tickets

Lesson Sequence:

1. Anticipatory Set (5 minutes)
- Display a pizza image divided into 8 slices with some missing
- Ask: "If we have a pizza cut into 8 equal slices and 3 are eaten, how can we describe what's left?"
- Think-pair-share: Students discuss with partners
- Connect to real-life experiences with sharing food

2. Direct Instruction (15 minutes)
- Introduce vocabulary: fraction, numerator, denominator, whole, part
- Use fraction circles to demonstrate 1/2, 1/4, and 1/3
- Model how to write fractions and label parts
- Interactive demonstration using virtual fraction tools
- Check for understanding through thumbs up/down

3. Guided Practice (15 minutes)
- Students work in pairs with fraction manipulatives
- Create different fractions using paper plates and markers
- Teacher circulates, provides feedback, addresses misconceptions
- Mini-lesson for struggling students at back table
- Extension: Challenge advanced students to find equivalent fractions

4. Independent Practice (8 minutes)
- Students complete differentiated worksheet:
  * Level 1: Identify fractions in pictures
  * Level 2: Create and label fractions
  * Level 3: Compare fractions and explain reasoning
- Quick assessment check-ins with individual students

5. Closure (7 minutes)
- Gallery walk to share fraction creations
- Students explain one fraction they created
- Exit ticket: Draw and label a fraction of your choice
- Preview tomorrow: Comparing fractions

Assessment Strategies:
- Formative: Observation during activities, questioning, exit tickets
- Summative: End-of-unit fraction assessment next week
- Informal checks: Thumbs up/down, partner discussions

Differentiation:
- For struggling learners: 
  * Provide pre-divided circles
  * Work with simpler fractions (halves, fourths)
  * Small group support
- For advanced learners:
  * Explore equivalent fractions
  * Create word problems using fractions
  * Compare and order fractions
- ELL supports:
  * Visual vocabulary cards
  * Sentence frames for explanations
  * Native language resources available

Homework:
- Find 3 examples of fractions at home (food, objects, etc.)
- Draw and label each example
- Family connection: Share fraction concepts with parents

Reflection Notes:
(To be completed after lesson)
- What worked well?
- What needs adjustment?
- Student misconceptions observed?
- Next steps for tomorrow?
