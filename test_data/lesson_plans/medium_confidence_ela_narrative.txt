English Language Arts Lesson - 3rd Grade
Mrs. Emily Rodriguez at Lincoln Elementary

Tomorrow's lesson (November 19, 2024) will focus on identifying main ideas in informational texts. I'll be working with my class of 22 students during our regular morning language arts block from 8:30-9:30.

The lesson aligns with Utah Core Standard 3.RI.2 - Determine the main idea of a text and recount key details. We've been building these skills all month, and students are ready for more complex texts.

I plan to start with a engaging hook - showing a mystery box and having students guess what's inside based on clues. This connects to our main idea work because they'll need to identify the most important clues. After the warm-up, I'll model the skill using a short article about endangered animals on the SmartBoard.

For the main activity, students will work in small groups with different informational texts about animals. Each group gets highlighters, sticky notes, and a graphic organizer. They'll identify the main idea and three supporting details. I'll circulate to provide support, especially for my struggling readers who will work with modified texts.

We'll assess understanding through group presentations where each team shares their main idea and explains their thinking. I'll also collect their graphic organizers to check individual understanding. For homework, students will practice with a take-home passage about their favorite animal.

Materials needed include: 6 different animal articles (copied and laminated), highlighters, sticky notes, graphic organizers, SmartBoard presentation, and the mystery box with props.

This lesson differentiates by providing texts at various reading levels and allowing students to work collaboratively. My ELL students will have vocabulary cards and can use native language resources if needed.
