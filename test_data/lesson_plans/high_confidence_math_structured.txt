LESSON PLAN

Teacher Name: Sarah Johnson
Date: 2024-11-18
Subject Area: Mathematics
Grade Levels: 5th Grade
School Name: Mountain View Elementary School

Lesson Topic: Understanding Fractions and Decimals
Class Period: 2nd Period (9:30-10:15 AM)
Duration: 45 minutes
Total Students: 24

UTAH CORE STANDARDS:
- 5.NF.3: Interpret a fraction as division of the numerator by the denominator
- 5.NF.7: Apply and extend previous understandings of division to divide unit fractions

LEARNING OBJECTIVES:
- Students will be able to convert fractions to decimals with 90% accuracy
- Students will explain the relationship between fractions and division
- Students will apply fraction-decimal conversion in real-world problems

MATERIALS:
- Fraction bars manipulatives
- Decimal place value charts
- Interactive whiteboard
- Student worksheets (25 copies)
- Calculators for verification
- Exit ticket forms

ASSESSMENT METHODS:
- Pre-assessment quiz (5 questions)
- Observation during guided practice
- Peer assessment during pair work
- Exit ticket with 3 conversion problems
- Homework assignment for additional practice

LESSON STRUCTURE:
1. Warm-up Activity (5 minutes): Quick review of previous lesson on equivalent fractions using visual models
2. Introduction (10 minutes): Present real-world scenario about sharing pizza to introduce fraction-decimal relationship
3. Direct Instruction (10 minutes): Demonstrate conversion process using division, model 3 examples on board
4. Guided Practice (10 minutes): Students work in pairs to complete 5 conversion problems with teacher support
5. Independent Practice (7 minutes): Individual work on worksheet problems with varying difficulty levels
6. Closure (3 minutes): Students complete exit ticket and share one key learning

DIFFERENTIATION STRATEGIES:
- Advanced learners: Challenge problems with repeating decimals
- Struggling learners: Provide fraction bars and extra visual supports
- ELL students: Vocabulary cards with visual representations

NOTES:
This lesson builds on last week's work with equivalent fractions. Students showed strong understanding of visual models but need practice with the division algorithm. Parent newsletter will include practice problems for home support.
