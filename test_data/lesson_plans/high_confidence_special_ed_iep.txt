- Students will decode words with bl-, cl-, and fl- blends
- Students will use blend words in simple sentences

MATERIALS:
- Magnetic letters for each student

- Sensory sand trays for letter formation
- iPads with phonics apps (backup activity)
- Visual supports and anchor charts
- Token reward system materials
- Noise-canceling headphones available

INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES:
1. Opening (5 min): Sensory warm-up with sand tray letter writing
2. Direct Instruction (10 min): Multi-sensory blend introduction
   - Visual: Color-coded blend cards
   - Auditory: Exaggerated pronunciation
   - Kinesthetic: Hand motions for each blend
3. Guided Practice (15 min): Rotating stations
   - Station 1: Magnetic letter blend building
   - Station 2: iPad phonics games

4. Independent Work (10 min): Differentiated word sorts
5. Closing (5 min): Share one word learned, earn tokens
