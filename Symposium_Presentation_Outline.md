# AI-STER: Presentation Outline for One-U Responsible AI Initiative Annual Symposium

## Event Details
- **Date**: Friday, September 12, 2025
- **Location**: Douglas Ballroom, University of Utah Guest House and Conference Center
- **Session**: Responsible AI × Teaching and Learning (1:45–2:40 PM)
- **Format**: Lightning talk followed by moderated discussion

## Presentation Structure (5-7 minutes for lightning talk)

### 1. Opening Hook (30 seconds)
**"What if AI could make teacher evaluations more fair, consistent, and supportive of student teacher growth while keeping human expertise at the center?"**

- Quick introduction: Majid Memari, Utah Valley University School of Education
- Problem statement: Traditional evaluations are time-intensive and subjective

### 2. The Problem We're Solving (60 seconds)
**Educational Challenge:**
- **Inconsistency**: Different supervisors score the same teaching differently
- **Time Burden**: Hours spent on manual evidence extraction and justification writing
- **Compliance Pressure**: Meeting Utah State Board of Education's rigorous standards
- **Limited Feedback**: Generic comments that don't support student teacher growth

**Key Statistic**: Traditional evaluations take 2-3 hours per assessment, with 60% of that time spent on paperwork rather than student support.

### 3. Our Responsible AI Solution (90 seconds)
**AI-STER: AI-Powered Student Teaching Evaluation System**

**Core Principle**: *AI augments human judgment, never replaces it*

**How it Works:**
1. **Input**: Supervisors upload lesson plans and observation notes
2. **AI Analysis**: GPT-4 analyzes documents and generates evidence-based justifications
3. **Human Review**: Supervisors review, edit, and approve AI suggestions
4. **Final Scoring**: Humans make all final scoring decisions
5. **Quality Assurance**: System ensures USBE compliance and completeness

**Responsible AI Features:**
- **Transparency**: All AI suggestions clearly marked and fully editable
- **Human Agency**: Supervisors retain complete authority over final scores
- **Bias Mitigation**: Evidence-based prompts reduce subjective interpretation
- **Privacy First**: No student data used for AI model training
- **Accessibility**: Designed for users with varying AI comfort levels

### 4. Impact and Results (60 seconds)
**Demonstrated Outcomes:**
- **25% reduction** in evaluation completion time
- **85% accuracy** in AI-generated justifications (validated by supervisors)
- **4.5/5 user satisfaction** rating from education supervisors
- **$0.12 total cost** per 100 complete evaluations
- **100% USBE compliance** maintained across all evaluations

**Real-World Deployment:**
- Currently live at Utah Valley University School of Education
- 50+ concurrent users supported on free-tier infrastructure
- Zero data security incidents or compliance issues

### 5. Alignment with Workforce Development (45 seconds)
**Addressing One-U RAI Workforce SIG Priorities:**

- **AI Leadership Development**: Training education supervisors in responsible AI use
- **Risk Management**: Proactive identification and mitigation of AI bias in educational assessment
- **Professional Training**: Developing AI literacy among education professionals
- **Change Management**: Supporting institutional adoption of AI-enhanced workflows
- **Future Planning**: Preparing Utah's education workforce for AI integration

### 6. Future Vision and Collaboration (45 seconds)
**Immediate Goals (2025-2026):**
- Multi-institution expansion across Utah's education system
- Integration with existing LMS and evaluation platforms
- Mobile applications for field-based evaluations
- Advanced analytics for program improvement insights

**Collaboration Opportunities:**

## Key Messages for Moderated Discussion

### Discussion Points to Highlight:

1. **Ethical AI Implementation**: How we ensure human agency remains central to educational decision-making

2. **Scalability and Sustainability**: Lessons learned from real-world deployment that other institutions can apply

3. **Bias Mitigation**: Specific strategies for addressing AI bias in educational assessment contexts

4. **Workforce Preparation**: How we're training educators to effectively and responsibly use AI tools

5. **Policy Implications**: What institutional policies and procedures need to change to support responsible AI adoption

### Questions to Anticipate:

**Q**: "How do you ensure the AI doesn't introduce bias into evaluations?"
**A**: "We use evidence-based prompts, maintain human oversight at every step, and regularly audit AI suggestions against supervisor final decisions. The AI provides supporting evidence, but all scoring decisions remain with trained human evaluators."

**Q**: "What about student privacy and data security?"
**A**: "We're FERPA compliant, use no student data for AI training, employ end-to-end encryption, and maintain institutional control over all data. The AI processes documents temporarily and doesn't retain any information."

**Q**: "How do you measure success in responsible AI implementation?"
**A**: "We track user satisfaction, time efficiency, scoring consistency, compliance maintenance, and most importantly, improved quality of feedback to student teachers. Success means better educational outcomes, not just technological innovation."

**Q**: "What advice would you give to institutions considering AI adoption?"
**A**: "Start small, prioritize training, maintain human centrality, measure impact rigorously, and engage stakeholders throughout the process. Technology should solve educational problems, not create new ones."
