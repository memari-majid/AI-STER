Elementary School ESL Lesson Plan

Today I'll be teaching my ESL class at Meadowbrook Elementary. The lesson is scheduled for November 15, 2024, during third period. I'm Mason Taylor, and I'll be working with 15 students ranging from kindergarten through fifth grade.

The main focus of today's 45-minute lesson will be general English language practice. While there isn't a specific Utah Core Standard for this lesson, it does support Social Studies Thinking Standards through cross-curricular connections.

My objectives for this lesson are to help students expand their English vocabulary, give them opportunities to practice conversational English, and work on their listening comprehension skills.

For this lesson, I'll need the following materials: ESL workbooks for each student, a set of vocabulary flashcards, audio materials for listening exercises, and the classroom whiteboard with markers.

The lesson will follow this structure: We'll start with a 10-minute warm-up activity to get students engaged. Then I'll spend 15 minutes introducing new vocabulary using the flashcards. The next 15 minutes will be dedicated to practice activities where students can use the new words in context. Finally, we'll wrap up with a 5-minute assessment activity.

To assess student progress, I'll use oral participation throughout the lesson, conduct a brief vocabulary quiz, and include a listening comprehension exercise. This hands-on, investigative approach helps students explore general topics while building their English skills.
