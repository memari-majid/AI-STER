# New Evaluation Workflow Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the new streamlined evaluation workflow implemented in AI-STER to improve user experience and AI accuracy. The updated system addresses the previous issue where individual "Generate AI justification" buttons were fragmented and non-functional.

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Streamlined User Experience**
- **Before:** Individual justification buttons under each assessment item (broken)
- **After:** Single workflow with bulk justification generation using supervisor observations

### 2. **Better AI Context**
- **Before:** AI generated justifications without full context
- **After:** AI uses comprehensive observation notes to generate evidence-based justifications

### 3. **Improved Workflow Logic**
- **Before:** Score → Individual Generate → Edit (fragmented)
- **After:** Observe → AI Analysis → Informed Scoring → Edit (evidence-based sequence)

## New Workflow Structure

### Step 1-2: Lesson Plan Analysis (Unchanged)
- Lesson plan upload and information extraction
- AI analysis and supervisor override capabilities
- Enhanced synthetic data integration with Utah DOE standards

### Step 3: Classroom Observation Notes (NEW)
```
📝 Detailed Observation Notes
- Large text area for comprehensive observations
- Structured prompts to guide supervisors
- Direct integration with AI justification generation
```

**Key Features:**
- 200px height text area for detailed notes
- Guided prompts covering all competency areas
- Saves to session state for persistence
- Required for AI justification generation

### Step 4: AI Analysis and Justification Generation (NEW)
```
🤖 Generate AI Analysis for Competencies
Conditions: Observation notes present + Lesson plan (optional)
Action: "Generate AI Analysis" button for each competency or bulk generation
Result: AI extracts evidence and creates comprehensive justifications
```

**Key Features:**
- AI analyzes lesson plans and observation notes to extract relevant information
- Generates evidence-based justifications before scoring
- Provides comprehensive analysis to inform supervisor decisions
- Bulk or individual generation options
- Works with or without lesson plans (better with)

### Step 5: Assessment Scoring with AI Insights (IMPROVED)
```
🎯 Informed Scoring Process
Left Column: AI Analysis & Justification    Right Column: Scoring Controls
- Display AI-generated analysis            - Dropdown score selectors
- Editable justification text             - Score based on observations + AI
- Evidence from lesson & observations     - Real-time validation
```

**Key Features:**
- Supervisors review AI analysis before scoring
- Score assignment based on observations AND AI insights
- Competencies grouped by area for organization
- Live score summaries and requirement tracking
- Integrated workflow: analysis → review → score

### Step 6: Review and Finalize (IMPROVED)
```
✏️ Individual Justification Editing
- Each competency shows: Code, Title, Score Level
- Large text areas for editing AI-generated content
- Individual fallback generation buttons for missing items
- Real-time updates to session state
```

**Key Features:**
- Only shows competencies that have been scored
- Pre-populated with AI-generated content
- Fully editable with live updates
- Individual generation as backup option

### Step 7: Professional Dispositions (Unchanged)
- Level 3+ requirement maintained
- Select slider interface preserved
- Real-time validation

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Changes

#### New OpenAI Service Method
```python
def generate_bulk_justifications(
    self,
    items: List[Dict],
    scores: Dict[str, int], 
    observation_notes: str,
    student_name: str,
    rubric_type: str
) -> Dict[str, str]:
```

**Features:**
- Generates justifications for all scored items in one API call
- Uses observation notes as primary context
- JSON response parsing with validation
- Fallback to individual generation if bulk fails
- 2000 token limit for comprehensive responses

#### Enhanced Session State Management
```python
# New session state variables
'observation_notes': ""           # Supervisor's detailed observations
'scores': {}                     # Competency scores (existing)
'justifications': {}             # AI-generated justifications (existing)
```

### Frontend Changes

#### New UI Components

1. **Observation Notes Section**
   - Large text area with guided prompts
   - Persistent session state storage
   - Required for AI generation

2. **Competency Scoring Interface**
   - Two-column layout (scoring + reference)
   - Grouped by competency area
   - Dropdown selectors with live descriptions
   - Real-time progress tracking

3. **Bulk Generation Controls**
   - Conditional display based on completion status
   - Primary action button for bulk generation
   - Clear all justifications option
   - Progress indicators and error handling

4. **Enhanced Justification Editor**
   - Individual text areas for each scored competency
   - Pre-populated with AI content
   - Individual generation fallbacks
   - Live session state updates

## User Experience Flow

### Ideal Path (Happy Path)
1. **Upload/Select** lesson plan → AI extracts basic info
2. **Record** detailed classroom observations
3. **Score** all competencies using dropdown selectors  
4. **Generate** all justifications with one click
5. **Review/Edit** individual justifications as needed
6. **Complete** evaluation with dispositions and save

### Alternative Paths
- **Manual Entry:** Skip lesson plan, enter info manually
- **Partial AI:** Individual justification generation for missing items
- **No AI:** Manual justification entry throughout
- **Draft Mode:** Save incomplete evaluations for later completion

## Benefits Achieved

### For Supervisors
- **Faster Workflow:** Bulk generation vs individual clicks
- **Better Quality:** AI uses full observation context
- **Logical Sequence:** Natural evaluation flow
- **Flexibility:** Can edit or regenerate as needed

### For AI Accuracy
- **Full Context:** Observation notes inform all justifications
- **Consistency:** Single API call ensures coherent responses
- **Evidence-Based:** Justifications reference specific observed behaviors
- **Aligned Responses:** All justifications maintain consistent tone and style

### For System Reliability
- **Error Handling:** Multiple fallback mechanisms
- **State Management:** Persistent session storage
- **Validation:** Required fields and completion checks
- **Performance:** Efficient bulk operations

- **Model:** gpt-4o-mini (configurable)
- **Max Tokens:** 2000 for bulk generation, 300 for individual
- **Temperature:** 0.6 for balance between creativity and consistency
- **Fallback:** Individual generation if bulk fails

### UI Settings

- **Scoring Layout:** 2:1 column ratio (scoring:reference)
- **Justification Areas:** 100px height per competency
- **Progress Tracking:** Real-time metrics and requirements

## Testing & Validation
